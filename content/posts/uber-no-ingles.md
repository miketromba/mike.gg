Once upon a recent uber ride, I was headed downtown to meet a friend for drinks.

I normally enjoy having conversations with the infinitely diverse population of uber drivers. I often treat it as a personal challenge; to find some way to connect with the other person in the span of a ten-to-fifteen-minute drive, especially if they seem very different from myself on the surface.

Lots of fun conversations and stories have funneled through the gap between the two front seats—ranging from political, to life lessons, to the hilariously vulgar, to shocking events they've experienced.

**However.**

On this rare, fateful occasion I was in a "not-super-in-the-mood-to-have-a-conversation" vibe.

To my dismay, the driver was very friendly.

He had a thick accent & his navigation system instructed him in Spanish. As I entered, he immediately began to spark-up a conversation.

*"How was your new year's?"*

He asked enthuiastically, with a warm and interested smile on his face. He made eye contact through the rear-view mirror as if to say, *"I know most people don't really care when they ask a question like that, but not me. I care. So, please, tell me how your new year's was. I'm tragically bored and you will improve my day a little if you ramble for me."* 

I couldn't turn down his friendly gesture and/or plea for help.

I quickly flicked-on my social battery and proceeded to laboriously recount my new year's in detail, making sure to include lots of conversational hook points for him to latch onto, in hopes that he could easily identify and pick-up on one, and morph the conversation into the direction he found most interesting.

Years of conversational practice, experimentation, mistakes, breakthroughs, and trial & error had led me to this point. I flexed just about every social muscle I could muster and produced what I thought was a well-structured, empathically-curated response for him. I loaded it with conversational layups for him to leverage. It wasn't my finest work, but I was damn proud of it. I was invested now. Genuinely curious as to which part sparked the most intrigue in him, where he would go next. I eagerly awaited his response.

*"Sorry no Inglés."*
