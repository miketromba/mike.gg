title: Live life on offense

The most interesting and meaningful things that have happened in my life have almost always been the result of taking some kind of divergent action. By divergent action, I mean an action that diverges from the normal momentum of life. An action that would not be the obvious next step if you were to project out your life on a timeline. An action. Not a reaction.

From a young age, we‚Äôre programmed to react. We‚Äôre handed tasks to accomplish, a set of rules to abide by, and we react accordingly. In fact, I believe most people live life in this reactive state, most of the time.

Take school, for example. The curriculum is already laid out for you, the tests & success criteria are concretely defined, and your job is to simply do exactly what has been handed to you. Learn the material, pass the tests.

For most adults, this pattern doesn‚Äôt end with school. It continues into the workplace, where your boss, often provided with their own set of initiatives and clear success criteria, tells you what has to be done, and your job is to react accordingly.

You scan your email inbox multiple times per day and look for incoming messages to react to. You wait for something to go wrong with your health to seek treatment. You wait to get fat until you consider nutrition & exercise. You wait for problems to arise in your relationships before investing any effort into improving them. You wait to be invited to do fun things instead of planning and sending the invites yourself.

The truth is, if you live life in a perpetually reactive state, on defense, you will probably never do or accomplish anything meaningful.

Probably. The exception to this is if you somehow find yourself taken under the wing of a person who does live on offense, a leader, who strategically charts the course for you to follow, which leads you to accomplish something meaningful. But this is unlikely. If you defer your life‚Äôs course to another individual or entity to decide, you will most likely help them achieve something meaningful. A cog in the wheel. A piece of the puzzle. Their puzzle. Not yours.

Unfortunately, this is probably a moot point, because if you are the type of person with the type of personality that naturally leads you to live reactively instead of proactively, it will probably be near impossible to meaningfully change this over a long enough time horizon to make a substantial difference in your life, deeming this essay effectively useless, aside from my own amusement in writing it. Your personality and behavioral proclivities are mostly genetic‚Ä¶ baked into the physical wiring of your brain. I may have lost you there, but I encourage you to do your own research on this.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt think it is always bad to live in a reactive state. In fact, it‚Äôs probably impossible. For most, the cognitive burden of consistently deciding what to do, from first principles, for every single step you take in life is unbearable. Decisions are stressful. They bring with them the burden of responsibility. Personal accountability. If things go wrong, you have no one to blame but yourself. You can‚Äôt simultaneously be the victim and the perpetrator. It was your decision, and it was the wrong one. Your fault. Ouch.

But for those who are willing to accept this burden‚Ä¶ to embrace it‚Ä¶ they will be rewarded with the potential to live a unique, custom-tailored life. To do things that have not yet been done. To explore territory previously unchartered.

So what does it actually look like to live on offense? Fortunately, it‚Äôs conceptually pretty simple. Living on offense requires 1) having and understanding your own values, 2) deciding how to live authentically in accordance with those values, and 3) actively managing & maintaining your trajectory, and fending off the constant, endless horde of invaders trying to scale the castle walls and usurp your plan in favor of theirs. Simple‚Ä¶ but not at all easy. It is effortful, induces stress, and exposes you to failure that you are fully and clearly accountable for.

Let me break this down into a higher resolution, so that you may have a clearly actionable takeaway from this essay.

## 1) Have and understand your own values

You might assume that you know what your values are. Honesty, integrity, blah blah blah. Ok, great, you have a few words that sound good. But have you sat down and seriously meditated on this? With each value you have, what is the opposing value or set of values that you‚Äôre giving up? Ok, so you want to be honest instead of being a liar. No shit. But what do you WANT from life, and what are you giving up in order to get it?

For example, if you value money, there is a significant cost associated with that. You may have to give up some amount of peace, healthy relationships, physical health, time spent with family, etc. but you may be willing to

If you value exploration & novelty in your life, you may have to give up stability in the many forms it comes in. Security, long-term relationships, a stable community & sense of belonging. But you may be willing to accept these trade-offs as you summit Mount Everest, or travel to 30 countries in a year.

Discovering your values is a heavy process. It doesn‚Äôt happen as the result of a 5-minute scribbling-into-a-notebook session. It requires deep, consistent reflection, introspection, and self-awareness. Not to mention, it‚Äôs a moving target. Your values fluctuate and evolve over time, which means that the subsequent steps associated with living on offense, which are dependent on your values, must also evolve alongside them.

Here are just a few of the values that I‚Äôve arrived at after years of introspection and refinement, as of the time of writing this.

- **Living on offense:** You‚Äôre reading about this one now. As you can see, this took a lot of time and thought to figure out, and there are clear trade-offs.
- **Honesty & authenticity:** Closely related to and interdependent with the previous. The tradeoff of living honestly is that you must continuously strive for, accept, and precisely communicate the truth‚Ä¶ even if unsavory. If you‚Äôre familiar with Jordan Peterson & his material, you will find that his life and work all revolve around this value.
- **Love:** Not exclusively in the romantic sense. I mean love for other humans, in general. Life feels better when you are loving to others, with no strings attached‚Ä¶ asking nothing in return. And when I say love, I mean the act of love. The feeling is ephemeral & occurs as an indirect result of performing loving actions regularly. Helping someone who‚Äôs suffering in some way. Being kind. Helping someone feel valued, heard, understood. I‚Äôm not particularly religious, but the Catholic faith seems to mostly revolve around this value. The tradeoff is vulnerability. Not everyone shares this value or lives by it regularly. Predators probably do not feel any desire to reciprocate love to their prey.
- **Simplicity:** Not only do I find that life is more enjoyable when things are simple, but I also find that when I overcomplicate or overthink things, there is a higher chance of getting something wrong. Simple things tend to be more obvious and less error-prone. The fewer moving parts, the fewer points of failure. The simple, intuitive answer, which took 30 seconds to arrive at, is often also the optimal one. The obvious trade-off is that this does not always hold true. Every system has a certain degree of ‚Äúfundamental complexity‚Äù - that is, the minimum amount of complexity required in order for the system to function and serve its purpose. Sure, fewer moving parts is often better, but if you remove the axle from the car, you won‚Äôt get very far.

There are a bunch more. Perhaps I will write essays on individual values in the future, because it‚Äôs hard to do them justice with just one bullet point worth of detail and nuance.

Feel free to use these as a starting point in your own reflection, but I encourage you to be honest with yourself, without judgment. Not all values are universally accepted as virtuous, and that is ok. You may have additional circumstances or context that justify them‚Äîthat others would not understand. I‚Äôve never been a prisoner, but I imagine an inmate in prison probably requires a different set of values than you or I, which may be perfectly reasonable within the context of the prisoner‚Äôs life, and, simultaneously, completely socially unacceptable & disgusting to the average, free, law-abiding, church-going citizen. That‚Äôs an extreme example, but you get the point. Remember, the core of this exercise is authenticity. Parroting the crowd would be entirely antithetical to this essay üòÇ.

I suspect most people are perpetually stuck on this step, because it is difficult & cognitively taxing.

## 2) Decide how to live authentically in accordance with those values

Once again, simple, but ain‚Äôt easy. It‚Äôs an iterative, ever-evolving process. The good news is, if you value your gut/intuition, you don‚Äôt have to completely lean on critical, logical, rigorous, analytical thought for this. Your gut is pretty good at surfacing the right ideas. The things that you know you ‚Äúshould‚Äù do with your life are typically bubbling just beneath the surface. But depending on how deeply censored your vision has become, they may be very difficult to see.
Give yourself the time and space to figure out what to do. Read back on your values on a regular basis, and ask yourself, am I living in accordance with this value? Fully open your eyes, and seek out the inconsistencies between your idealized values and how you‚Äôre actually living your life. The gaps represent potential to change things. And as these gaps enter into your field of view, ideas will inevitably spawn, giving you the opportunity to act on them and make changes.

And guess what? The act of proactively changing and reshaping your life is, you guessed it, living on offense!

## 3) Actively manage & maintain your trajectory, and fend off the constant, endless horde of invaders trying to scale the castle walls and usurp your plan in favor of theirs

Entropy. Everything trends toward chaos over time. You may have perfectly figured out & defined your values. You may have completely reshaped your life around those values. But perhaps the hardest step is defending your values and lifestyle over time‚Äîfrom yourself, from others, and from the quiet, passive, gentle, invisible, consistent, perpetual, yet insidious drone of societal pressure.

### 1) Defending against yourself

The first step is accepting that while you are your own best ally, you are also your own worst enemy.

You must always be diligent and fend off:

- **Distractions:** Shiny objects regularly float by, and sirens regularly sing in the distance. You must always fight the current. And sometimes you‚Äôll lose. Two steps forward, one step back.
- **Fatigue:** Anything that requires stable effort, cognition, and maintenance over an endless time horizon sucks. You must change the oil regularly, or the engine will seize. You‚Äôre signing up for a life of perpetual intentionality. Meaningful, rewarding, fulfilling, but fucking hard sometimes. Especially when you make bad decisions and you have to accept the potentially substantial loss associated with those decisions as entirely your fault. It‚Äôs tiring. Therefore you must treat yourself and your life like an athlete. You must take care of your health, mind, and soul, so that you can awake each morning and continue to fight the battle with vigor & enthusiasm.
- **Decay:** The invigorating clarity and potency of the values you discover and life changes you make will be at an all-time high at the start. But this enthusiasm will decay. Your mind will wander. ‚ÄúLife shit‚Äù will happen and force you into a reactive state. You‚Äôll have to fight the inertia of reactivity over and over to maintain this proactive agency in your life. To toggle back into offense mode.

### 2) Defending against others

This one is often obvious. You have an objective, and your adversary has an opposing or tangential objective. Overt negotiation or collaborative problem solving is the result.

But sometimes this clash of intentions is not always so obvious. You may both appear to be headed in the same direction. You may both even agree so, and use the same words to verbalize your ‚Äúshared‚Äù intentions. But this is not sufficient. The truth is, most people don‚Äôt know what they want. Most people have not reflected or tailored their lives to the degree that you have. When you present your vision to them, with sharp and compelling confidence, they may be temporarily seduced into believing they share your intentions.

Alternatively, as unlikely as it is, you may actually share the same exact values and life intentions as your counterpart. The problem is, as I alluded to earlier, your values evolve over time, and therefore, so too does your authentic life path. If you‚Äôre effectively living this philosophy, then you‚Äôre probably aware of this effect, and you‚Äôre consistently course-correcting, often a few degrees at a time. However, your counterpart may not be. They may continue to assume that the ship is headed in its original destination‚Äîor that it is automatically adjusting its course to account for their evolving interests and desires.

And last but not least, you must be wary of those who are purposely deceitful. They may say the right things and appear to have your best interests in mind. And at first, their behaviors may align with this facade. But slowly, over time, little by little, they may gradually adjust the course of the ship, without your awareness. One degree at a time, until the destination no longer holds any resemblance to your intentions.

As you can see, all other people are accounted for in this equation. Everyone has their own interests and will ultimately aim to fulfill them, regardless of whether or not yours are respected along the way.

The solution is the same: you must remain diligent in observing your values as they shift over time, and constantly adjust the course of the ship accordingly. This way, even if the rudder is tampered with, or adjusted without your awareness, you can detect this change and remedy it before you land in the wrong place. Additionally, you may also consider removing the biggest detractors‚Äîthose whose interests least align with your authentic life path‚Äîfrom your life, where possible. The act of curating the people you surround yourself with is an important part of living your life on offense.

### 3) Defending against the quiet, passive, gentle, invisible, consistent, perpetual, yet insidious drone of societal pressure

This one is dangerous because it's not obvious. It's like water running down the side of a mountain. Its gentle pressure and friction, over a long enough period of time, eventually carve out a formidable ridge, fundamentally reshaping the terrain. We don't live in a void. Our subconscious is constantly seeking approval from others. As a hunter-gatherer, deviating from the norm and losing the favor of the pack often meant death. It was essential to fit in.

This poses an interesting challenge. Our psychology is fundamentally wired against the concept of living authentically, on offense. This manifests itself subtly, by triggering small, yet efficacious emotions that gently steer you toward satisfying the expectations of others, instead of pursuing your authentic path.

Two solutions. Both the same as in the prior section. 1) Curate your environment‚Äîaim to surround yourself with, and associate with, other people or groups who share your values, and organically propel you along your path as a result. 2) remain diligent in regularly correcting course.

## In conclusion

If you are reading this, you're most likely the type of person that naturally feels the drive to live life on offense. Therefore, I hope this essay has given you some additional structure to manage & direct this drive, and the reassurance that you should not suppress it. If you are this person, and you live life in a reactive state, you will be perpetually frustrated, disappointed, and depressed. The solution is to start small. Take your time, and go through the steps. This isn't a five-minute exercise... it's a lifelong journey, and making any progress will already begin to relieve the pain of feeling like you're not in control of the ship.
