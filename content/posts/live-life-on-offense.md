The most interesting and meaningful things that have happened in my life have almost always been the result of taking some kind of divergent action. By divergent action, I mean an action that diverges from the normal momentum of life. An action that would not be the obvious next step if you were to project out your life on a timeline. An action. Not a reaction.

From a young age, we’re programmed to react. We’re handed tasks to accomplish, a set of rules to abide by, and we react accordingly. I believe most people live life in this reactive state, most of the time.

Take school, for example. The curriculum is already laid out for you, the tests & success criteria are pre-defined, and your job is to simply do exactly what has been handed to you. Learn the material, pass the tests.

For most adults, this pattern doesn’t end with school. It continues into the workplace, where your boss, often provided with their own set of initiatives and clear success criteria, tells you what has to be done, and you react accordingly.

You scan your email inbox multiple times per day and look for messages to react to. You wait for something to go wrong with your health to seek treatment. You wait to get fat before considering nutrition & exercise. You wait for problems to arise in your relationships instead of proactively improving them. You wait to be invited to things instead of planning and sending the invites yourself.

The truth is, if you live life in a perpetually reactive state, on defense, you will probably never do or accomplish anything unique or significant.

Probably. The exception to this is if you somehow find yourself taken under the wing of a person who does live on offense, a leader, who strategically charts the course for you to follow, which leads you to accomplish something meaningful. But this is unlikely. If you defer your life’s course to another individual or entity to decide, you will more likely help *them* achieve something meaningful. A cog in the wheel. A piece of the puzzle. **Their puzzle.** Not yours.

Unfortunately, this is probably a moot point, because if you are the type of person with the type of personality that naturally leads you to live reactively instead of proactively, it will be very difficult to meaningfully change this over a long enough time horizon to make a substantial difference in your life, deeming this post effectively useless, aside from my own amusement in writing it. Your personality and behavioral proclivities are mostly genetic… baked into the physical wiring of your brain. I may have lost you there, but I encourage you to do your own research on this.

To be clear, I don’t think it is always bad to live in a reactive state. In fact, it’s impossible to live entirely on offense. The cognitive burden of consistently deciding what to do, from first principles, for every single step you take in life is very hard. Decisions are stressful. They bring with them the burden of responsibility. Personal accountability. If things go wrong, you have no one to blame but yourself. You can’t simultaneously be the victim and the perpetrator. It was your decision, and it was the wrong one. Your fault.

But for those who are willing to accept this burden… and embrace it… they will be rewarded with the potential to live a unique, custom-tailored life. To do things that have not yet been done. To explore territory previously unchartered.

So what does it actually look like to live on offense? It’s conceptually pretty simple. Living on offense requires 1) having and understanding your own values, 2) deciding how to live authentically in accordance with those values, and 3) actively managing & maintaining your trajectory, and fending off the constant, endless horde of invaders trying to scale the castle walls and usurp your plan in favor of theirs. Simple… but not at all easy. It is effortful, stressful, and exposes you to failure that you are fully and clearly accountable for.

Each deserves an explanation.

## 1) Have and understand your own values

You might assume that you know what your values are. Integrity, passion, blah blah blah. Ok, you have a few words that sound good. But what are the opposing values that you’re giving up? Ok, so you want to be honest instead of being a liar. No shit. But what do you WANT from life, and what are you giving up in order to get it?

For example, if you value money, there is a significant cost associated with that. You may have to give up some amount of peace, healthy relationships, physical health, time spent with family, etc.

If you value exploration & novelty in your life, you may have to give up stability in the many forms it comes in. Security, long-term relationships, a stable community & sense of belonging. But you may be willing to accept these trade-offs as you summit Mount Everest, or travel to 30 countries in a year.

Discovering your values is a heavy process. It doesn’t happen as the result of a 5-minute scribbling-into-a-notebook session. It requires deep, consistent reflection, introspection, and self-awareness. It’s also a moving target. Your values fluctuate and evolve over time, which means that the subsequent steps associated with living on offense, which are dependent on your values, must evolve alongside them.

Here are a few of the values I’ve arrived at after years of introspection and refinement, as of the time of writing this.

- **Living on offense:** You’re reading about this one now. As you can see, there are clear trade-offs.
- **Honesty & authenticity:** Closely related to and interdependent with the previous. The trade-off of living honestly is that you must continuously strive for, accept, and precisely communicate the truth… even when unsavory. If you’re familiar with Jordan Peterson & his material, you will find that his life and work all revolve around this value.
- **Love:** Not exclusively in the romantic sense. I mean love for other humans, in general. Life feels better when you are loving to others, with no strings attached… asking nothing in return. I'm referring to the act of love. The feeling is ephemeral & occurs as an indirect result of performing loving actions regularly. Helping someone who’s suffering in some way. Being kind. Helping someone feel valued, heard, understood. I’m not particularly religious, but the Catholic faith seems to mostly revolve around this value. The trade-off is vulnerability. Not everyone shares this value or lives by it regularly. Predators probably do not feel any desire to reciprocate love to their prey. By loving openly, you expose yourself to many new vectors of attack.
- **Simplicity:** Not only do I find that life is more enjoyable when things are simple, but I also find that when I overcomplicate or overthink things, there is a higher chance of getting something wrong. Simple things tend to be more obvious and less error-prone. The fewer moving parts, the fewer points of failure. The simple, intuitive answer, which took 30 seconds to arrive at, is often the optimal one. The obvious trade-off is that this does not always hold true. Every system has a certain degree of “fundamental complexity” - that is, the minimum amount of complexity required in order for the system to function and serve its purpose. Sure, fewer moving parts is often better, but if you remove an axle from the car, you won’t get very far.

There are a bunch more. It’s hard to do them justice with just one bullet point worth of detail.

Feel free to use these as a starting point in your own reflection, but I encourage you to be honest with yourself, without judgment. Not all values are universally accepted as virtuous, and that is ok. You may have additional circumstances or context that justify them—that others would not understand. I imagine an inmate in prison probably requires a different set of values than you or I, which may be perfectly reasonable within the context of the prisoner’s life, and, simultaneously, completely socially unacceptable & repulsive to the average, free, law-abiding citizen. That’s an extreme example, but you get the point. Remember, the core of this exercise is authenticity. Adopting someone elses values without congruence with your own mind would be entirely antithetical to this essay.

I suspect most people are perpetually stuck on this step, because they are blind to their own values, and it is challenging / takes time to uncover them.

## 2) Decide how to live authentically in accordance with those values

Once again, simple, but not easy. All of this is an iterative, evolving process. Fortunately, the things that you know you “should” do with are typically bubbling just beneath the surface. However, depending on how deeply censored your vision has become, they may be difficult to see.

There's a simple technique to figure out the changes you need to make in your life. Here it is: Write down & re-read your values on a regular basis, and ask yourself, am I living in accordance with each value? Aim to identify the inconsistencies between your idealized values and how you’re actually living your life. The gaps represent your potential to change things. And as these gaps enter your field of view, the right ideas will inevitably spawn, giving you the opportunity to act on them and make changes.

It's important to empty your mind & open your heart before doing this. Meditate for a moment to release any residual thoughts or feelings from the day. Your goal to see as clearly as possible, without the fog of your life's current state and trajectory clouding your view.

If you've made it this far, congrats. The act of proactively changing and reshaping your life is, you guessed it, living on offense.

## 3) Actively manage & maintain your trajectory, and fend off the constant, endless horde of invaders trying to scale the castle walls and usurp your plan in favor of theirs

Entropy. Everything trends toward chaos over time. You may have precisely uncovered & defined your values. You may have completely reshaped your life around those values. But perhaps the hardest step is defending your values and lifestyle over time—from yourself, from others, and from the quiet, passive, insidious drone of societal pressure.

### 1) Defending against yourself

The first step is accepting that you are your own worst enemy.

You must remain diligent and fend off:

- **Distractions:** Shiny objects constantly float by, and sirens sing in the distance. The currents of life will frequently tempt you away from your authentic life path. Sometimes you’ll be swept up in them. But continue to refocus and do not lose faith. Be willing to take one step back for every two steps forward.
- **Fatigue:** Anything that requires stable effort, cognition, and maintenance over an endless time horizon sucks. You must change the oil regularly, or the engine will seize. You’re signing up for a life of perpetual intentionality. Meaningful, rewarding, fulfilling, but fucking hard sometimes. Especially when you make bad decisions and you have to accept the potentially substantial loss associated with those decisions as entirely your fault. Living on offense is tiring. You're not floating in the river of life, allowing it to take you where it may. No, not for you. You've built your own boat, charted your own course, and are actively paddling against chaotic, swirling currents at all times. Therefore, it's essential that you treat yourself and your life as though you are a high-performance athlete. You must take care of your health, mind, and soul, so that you can awake each morning and continue to fight the currents with vigor & enthusiasm. And when do you do this for long enough, you may be pleased to find that you have developed your own current, a personal momentum, that cuts through the swirling mess & helps you stay on course, with less effort than the day you embarked.
- **Decay:** The clarity and potency you will feel when you first uncover your values, and the enthuiastic optimism you will experience when you initiate the corresponding life changes, will be at an all-time high at the start. But this enthusiasm will decay. Your mind will wander. “Life shit” will happen, inevitably forcing you back into a reactive state. You’ll have to fight the inertia of reactivity over and over to maintain your offensive posture. You may get swept up by the river on occasion. Your boat may be damaged. Get up, rebuild, and re-embark.

### 2) Defending against others

This one is often obvious. You have an objective in your life, and your "adversary" has an opposing or tangential objective. The unfortunate truth is, the longer you remain in this individual's company, the harder it will be to move in your authentic direction. You water of the river will thicken and you will have to paddle with double the force to traverse the same distance. While not always feasable, the ultimate solution is to remove the obstacle from your life. Release those individuals who serve as a headwind instead of a tailwind.

Alternatively, you may be tempted into negotiation. Although you'd like to go to point A, instead of point C, you may compromise on point B. The problem is that any point, other than "A," is inauthentic. It is in misalignment with your values. You will be once again, living defensively.

You may be wondering, does this mean that I must seclude myself to a life of isolation? Must I remove everyone who's headed in an even slightly different destination than my own? Not at all. As it turns out, most people do not live on offense, and would much prefer to be taken under the wing of a strong, competent, and confident captain who does. There is such thing as a passenger who would be thrilled to come along for the ride. They are afforded the benefit of joining you on the journey, and landing at the same destination you're headed, without ever having to suffer the painful challenges and brutal consequences of living on offense—as you have. It's a compelling proposition. If you find this concept curious, and in particular how it relates to mating and dating, I highly recommend the book, [The Value Of Others by Dr. Orion Taraban](https://www.amazon.com/Value-Others-Understanding-Relationships-Marketplace-ebook/dp/B0D1Q5LHNV). Many of the analogies used here were borrowed or inspired from this book.

There are other types of "detractors," individuals who lead you off-course, too.

Often, you may find that the clash of intentions between yourself and another individual are not so obvious. You may both appear to be headed in the same direction. You may both even agree so, and use the same words to verbalize your “shared” intentions. But this is not sufficient. The truth is, most people don’t know what they want. Most people have not reflected or tailored their lives to the degree that you have. When you present your life's vision to them, with sharp and compelling confidence, they may be temporarily seduced into believing they share your intentions—all the while, either conciously or unconciously unwilling to be a passenger.

And in some cases, you may even share the same exact values and life intentions as your counterpart. The problem is, as I alluded to earlier, your (and your counterpart's) values evolve over time, and therefore, so too does your authentic life path. If you’re effectively living this philosophy, then you’re probably aware of this effect, and you’re consistently course-correcting, often a few degrees at a time. However, your counterpart may not be. They may continue to assume that the ship is headed toward its original destination—or that it is magically adjusting course to account for their evolving interests and desires.

And last but not least, you must be wary of those who are purposely deceitful. They may say the right things and appear to have your best interests in mind. And at first, their behaviors may align with this facade. But slowly, over time, little by little, they may gradually adjust the course of the ship, without your awareness. One degree at a time... until the destination no longer holds any semblance to your authentic intention.

The truth is, everyone has their own interests and will ultimately aim to fulfill them, regardless of whether or not yours are respected along the way. 

The solution is the same: you must remain diligent in observing your values as they shift over time, and constantly adjust the course of the ship accordingly. This way, even if the wheel is tampered with, you can detect this change and remedy it with haste, before you land in the wrong place. Additionally, you may also consider removing the biggest detractors—those whose interests least align with your authentic life path and are unwilling to be loyal passengers—from your life. The act of curating the people you surround yourself with is an important part of living life on offense.

### 3) Defending against the quiet, passive, insidious drone of societal pressure

This one is dangerous because it's not obvious. It's like water running down the side of a mountain. Its gentle pressure and friction, over a long enough period of time, eventually carve out a formidable ridge, fundamentally reshaping the terrain. We don't live in a void. Our subconscious is constantly seeking approval from others. As a hunter-gatherer, deviating from the norm meant potentially losing the favor of the pack, and ultimately, abandonment and death. It was essential to fit in.

This poses an interesting challenge. Our minds are, in many ways, wired against the concept of living on offense. This manifests itself subtly, by triggering small, almost unnoticable emotions that gently steer you toward satisfying the expectations of others, instead of staying the course, and pursuing your authentic path.

Once again, the solutions are the same. 1) Curate your environment—surround yourself with, and associate with, other people or groups who serve as tailwinds, not headwinds. 2) Remain diligent in regularly tracking & correcting your course.

## In conclusion

If you are reading this, you're most likely the type of person that naturally feels the drive to live life on offense. Therefore, I hope this essay has given you some additional structure to manage & direct this drive, and the reassurance that you should not suppress it. If you are this person, and you live life in a reactive state, you will be perpetually frustrated, disappointed, and depressed. The solution is to start small. Take your time, and walk through the steps. This isn't a five-minute exercise... it's a lifelong journey. Making any progress will already begin to relieve the pain of feeling like you have no control of the ship.
