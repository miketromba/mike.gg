Once upon a recent uber ride, I was headed downtown to meet a friend for drinks.

I normally enjoy having conversations with the infinitely diverse population of uber drivers. I often treat it as a personal challenge; to find some way to connect with the person in the span of a ten or 15-minute drive—especially if they seem very different from myself on the surface.

Lots of fun conversations and stories have funneled through the gap between the two front seats—ranging from political, to life lessons, to hilariously vulgar, to shocking events they've experienced.

However.

On this rare occasion I was in a "not-super-in-the-mood-to-have-a-conversation" vibe. To my dismay, the driver was very friendly.

He had a thick accent & his navigation system instructed him in Spanish. As I entered, he immediately began to spark up a conversation.

*"How was your new year?"*

He asked enthuiastically, with a warm and interested smile on his face. He made eye contact through the rear-view mirror as if to say, *"I know most people don't really care when they ask a question like that, but I'm different. I care. So, please, tell me how your new year was. I'm bored and you will improve my day a little if you ramble for me."* 

I couldn't turn down his friendly gesture and/or plea for help. I quickly flicked-on my social battery and proceeded to laboriously recount my new year in detail, making sure to include lots of conversational hook points for him to latch onto, in hopes that he could easily identify and pick-up on one, and morph the conversation in the direction he found most interesting.

Years of conversational practice, experimentation, mistakes, breakthroughs, and trial & error had led me to this point. I flexed just about every social muscle I could muster and produced what I thought was a well-structured, empathically-curated response for him. I loaded it with conversational layups for him to leverage. It wasn't my finest work, but I was damn proud of it. I was invested now. Deeply curious as to which part sparked the most intrigue in him. I eagerly awaited his response.

*"Sorry no Englais."*
