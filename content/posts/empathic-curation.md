On this week's episode of basic social skills that most of gen-z does not posess 101:

*If you want to feel connected, shut up & listen.* Most of us live in our own heads 24/7. And this feels isolating. We desperately want someone to see our world as we do. This often results in unloading an endless monologue on your victim—with little-to-no consideration of the other person's needs or interests. This is a mistake.

## To feel connected, you must connect

Your goal is to feel connected. However, the result of "brain dumping" on someone else is often the opposite. You push them away. You reveal just how dissimilar you are. You emphasize the gaps between you and the other person. You demonstrate a lack of empathy for them.

Your logic is, if I dump every thought I currently have in my brain on them, they will understand me and I will feel connected. The problem with this logic is that the other person is living in their own, deeply complex world as well. You're asking them to enthuiastically wipe their hard drive to make room for all of your spam instead.

> **Spam:** the same message sent indiscriminately to a large number of recipients

Almost no one likes this & will avoid you as a consequence. Self-induced isolation.

## Empathic curation

It turns out that if you infuse just a touch empathy into your approach—that is, you step outside of your own head for a moment and consider the other person's world—you can achieve your goal of feeling connected far more effectively. Here's what it looks like in practice:

1. **Clear your mind.** Put all of the things you want to communicate into a bucket and forget about them.
2. **Empathize & listen.** Do your best to estimate what the other person has in their own bucket. What do they really want to communicate? What are their needs within this interaction? An easy way to find out is, you guessed it, to ask questions. Be a scientist about it. Come up with a hypothesis, experiment by asking them a question, observe their response, and repeat the process until you've uncovered what's in their bucket.
3. **Connect.** As the conversation proceeds, if you've correctly done the two steps above, you will inevitably connect. As it turns out, pretty much all humans care about the same shit. We have the same emotions, troubles, desires, worries, etc. What will happen is, your questions, and the answers you receive, will start to organically synergize with the things that are in your own bucket. You'll start to notice clear, obvious opportunities to communicate those things within the natural flow of the conversation. At this point, the other person will likely reciprocate an attentive, genuine interest in what you have to say. You've given them the wonderful feeling of connection, and they will begin to actively seek more with you. As you start to reveal the things in your own bucket, little-by-little, at the right moments, the other person will begin to offer connection in return. They may ask you follow-up questions out of genuine curiosity, or say things like, "I competely get what you mean, that reminds me of X."

Boom, connection.

I think a good name for this is **"empathic curation."** You *curate* what (and when) you communicate to another person, based on the other person's needs and interests. The result is a mutually beneficial interaction—leaving both parties feeling connected and understood.

> **Empathic curation:** Curating the information you choose communicate, and the timing of such communication, with respect to the other person's needs and interests, with the goal of achieving a mutually beneficial interaction that leaves both parties feeling equally connected and understood.

Remember, step three will happen naturally. If you rush to jam your thoughts into the dialogue, you will only increase the distance between yourself and the other person.

## Sometimes brain-dumping is ok because a small minority of people enjoy receiving it (a counter-point)

Some people enjoy giving others the gift of connection. I say gift in this case, because it is not an exchange, transaction, or trade. It's a one-way gift; no compensation in return. Certain people are wired to intrinsically enjoy this. Often they're referred to as "Empaths." Empaths are a rare group that will enthuiastically "wipe their hard drives to make room for your spam," and take pleasure in doing so. This comes with a host of downsides for these types of individuals, specifically when it comes to boundry-setting and prioritizing their own needs. But these people do exist, and they probably exist for a reason. *(That may be a spiritual statement or maybe just an Darwinist one. I'll leave it up to you.)*

It will probably be obvious when you are interacting with a person like this. Unlike others, they will deeply & attentively listen to your one-way brain-dumping, and produce facial expressions & body language that mirror the exact emotions you're feeling. It's not a facade. Their mind is simulating those emotions too. You will feel a sense of connection, without having to ask a single question or know a single thing about them.

**Side-note:** *Because these people are uncommon, and because you may be projecting your own average amount of empathy onto them, you may find yourself feeling skeptical. It's too good to be true. Almost everyone you've ever brain-dumped on has left you feeling even more disconnected and isolated. Your mind may explain this difference as, "this must be a trick," or, "what do they want from me?" You may reject their gift of connection as a result.*

**Side-note 2:** *This protective mechanism isn't always wrong. On the other end of the spectrum, psychopathy, ironically, can manifest itself in a way that appears very similar. Psychopaths may simulate this warm, loving, empathetic facade—purely as a means of manipulating you such that they can extract what they want.*

## Why are so many gen-z Americans addicted to talk therapy?

Simple. Because they're able to receive the connection they're craving, one-way, from a trained professional who's an expert at delivering it, in exchange for money.

And sure, often therapists are the type of people who genuinely enjoy providing this service. But let's be clear—there's a transaction at the core, and it *is* a service.

Talk therapy addiction is a natural result of the modern, widespread inability to connect with others in a non-transactional, organic, mutually-beneficial way. It's a shortcut: a weekly "hit" of the connection & understanding you crave, without requiring you to develop any skills, forge healthy relationships, or expend any effort in order to receive it.

One-sided, selfish brain-dumping is encouraged, rewarded, and the cycle of isolation continues.

**Side-note:** *Obviously I am not suggesting that talk therapy is bad, and there are many fantastic benefits of, and use-cases for it.*

## Conclusion

If you want to feel connected, shut up & listen. Get out of your own head, and instead, aim to fully hear & understand the person you're communicating with. Empathically curate your communication. Practice this way of communicating regularly and you may find that connecting with others is actually pretty easy.
